# Manage Academy Free Angular 2+ Admin Template [![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social&logo=twitter)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Manage Academy%20-%20Free%20Bootstrap%204%20Admin%20Template%20&url=https://coreui.io&hashtags=bootstrap,admin,template,dashboard,panel,free,angular,react,vue)

Please help us on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/coreui-open-source-bootstrap-4-admin-template-with-angular-2-react-js-vue-js-support) and [Designer News](https://www.designernews.co/stories/81127). Thanks in advance!

Curious why I decided to create Manage Academy? Please read this article: [Jack of all trades, master of none. Why Bootstrap Admin Templates suck.](https://medium.com/@lukaszholeczek/jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none-5ea53ef8a1f#.7eqx1bcd8)

Manage Academy is an Open Source Bootstrap Admin Template. But Manage Academy is not just another Admin Template. It goes way beyond hitherto admin templates thanks to transparent code and file structure. And if that's not enough, let’s just add that Manage Academy consists bunch of unique features and over 1000 high quality icons.

Manage Academy is based on Bootstrap 4 and offers 6 versions: [HTML5 AJAX](https://github.com/coreui/free-bootstrap-admin-template-ajax), [HTML5](https://github.com/coreui/free-angular-admin-template), [Angular 2+](https://github.com/coreui/free-angular-admin-template), [React.js](https://github.com/coreui/free-react-admin-template) & [Vue.js](https://github.com/coreui/free-vue-admin-template), [.NET Core 2](https://github.com/coreui/free-dotnet-admin-template).

Manage Academy is meant to be the UX game changer. Pure & transparent code is devoid of redundant components, so the app is light enough to offer ultimate user experience. This means mobile devices also, where the navigation is just as easy and intuitive as on a desktop or laptop. The Manage Academy Layout API lets you customize your project for almost any device – be it Mobile, Web or WebApp – Manage Academy covers them all!

There is only one limitation you can't re-distribute the Manage Academy as stock. You can’t do this if you modify the Manage Academy. In past we faced some problems with persons who tried to sell Manage Academy based templates.

## Support Manage Academy Development

Manage Academy is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper financial backing. You can support development by donating on [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/holeczek), buying [Manage Academy Pro Version](https://coreui.io/pro) or buying one of our [premium admin templates](https://genesisui.com/?support=1).

As of now I am exploring the possibility of working on Manage Academy fulltime - if you are a business that is building core products using Manage Academy, I am also open to conversations regarding custom sponsorship / consulting arrangements.
